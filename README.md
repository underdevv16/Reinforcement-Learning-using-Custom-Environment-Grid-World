# Reinforcement-Learning-using-Custom-Environment-Grid-World-
A custom 9x9 GridWorld environment built with Python and Pygame for reinforcement learning. The agent navigates the grid, utilizing two distinct sets of portals to move between entry and exit points, aiming to reach a designated goal. Ideal for testing and visualizing RL algorithms in a dynamic environment.
